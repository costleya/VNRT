"Instances":[{"Dialog":{"Text":"The room was dark and quiet, the only light coming from the gentle rays of the sun as it began its ascent into the sky. The door clicked shut behind him, almost sounding as if had slammed for how disturbingly silent it was in the king's study. Shirou swept his eyes around the office quickly before coming to rest on the figure sitting at her desk. He walked forward slowly, wondering if perhaps King Arthur was taking a break from all of her paperwork, and he was about to greet her when he found himself coming to an immediate halt. The candles on her desktop had long since gone out, and it was hard to tell out her features except for where a small sliver of sunlight hit her just right. Obviously exhausted, her head rested over her left hand, a quill still in her right as shoulders shifted just barely as she breathed in and out slowly. Her eyes were closed, and all signs of her normal stress, concern, and problems were absent from her expression as she rested serenely. The king's tendrils of hair fell over her eyes, waving slightly with each breath she exhaled, and the entire scene made her seem innocent, young, and a complete contrast to her normal countenance. Shirou couldn't help but stare, and when he heard the telltale sound of his dishes sliding, he quickly righted the tray and, taking a single, deep breath, put the tray aside on one of the chairs meant for the king's guests. When his golden-brown eyes peered back at her again, he found that she hadn't moved even the slightest. He couldn't take his eyes off of her. Perhaps he should have been concerned when there was no answer at the very first knock he'd made to her door. King Arthur was not an intentionally rude person - if she was busy, she would simply ask him to come at a different time. But, then again there were times when she was so deep into her work, that she just didn't hear any outside influences. Those times were rare, but still happened every now and then. Actually, it had happened just last week, if he recalled correctly. That time, Shirou had stood outside of the office for at least ten minutes before trying again, and she was certain to apologize about the incident. When the second knock and call went unanswered, that waved a few red flags that had him narrowing his eyes a bit. Maybe she simply wasn't in her office? But the king was always in her office at the ass crack of dawn, and he would've received a notification from that steward of hers, whatever the hell his name was, otherwise. The steward was nothing if not prompt and quick to inform. At the third knock and call, Shirou finally realized that there might've been something wrong on her end, and he took a cautious step back. It was probably unnecessary of him to do so, but he immediately thought up the number of things that could have gone wrong: she had Avalon, so that shouldn't have been an issue; it was a closed-quartered room, without any breaches that he'd noticed, which was another thing to dismiss; any signs of struggle would've been noticed by the guards standing at the sides of her door; he was in charge of everything she ate, but that was still negated by Avalon, which made it a moot point; could something have come in through the window - a sleeping gas, maybe? But, to Shirou's knowledge, that hadn't technically been invented yet.So, when he had made his way inside, ready for the worst, the sight of her like...this, froze him to the core. Even during his time with Saber, when had he ever really seen her look so relaxed, so calm, so...small and sweet? The time she had been meditating in his house's dojo couldn't compare. The time she had lain in the room next to his to conserve energy, couldn't compare. Not even their night together could compare to how she seemed now. Excepting the last example, the woman had been ready to take on the world if need be - she would have launched from her meditational pose to her feet in a heartbeat, from the realm of sleep to an attacking stance in less than a second. But her, right now? Certainly, she could, but...it was different. This was her safe haven, in her castle, in her territory, her time, surrounded by her people, who would jump to protect her at the cost of their lives. It was different, and he knew it. Even if she didn't trust everyone, even if she were wary of problems within her haven, it was still her home, not a battlefield where she had to protect her idiot Master. Shirou forcibly cast down his gaze before involuntarily zeroing back in on her again. His feet taking him closer to her desk, Shirou couldn't help but continue to stare. His thoughts always pushed him back towards his time with Saber, towards their two weeks together, whenever he saw the king. Never had Shirou regretted letting her go at the end of the war - she hadn't belonged in his time, in a place among the living. He never regretted saying goodbye, but he had wished they could've done more, could've had the chance to experience other things. Shirou remembered her expressions of happiness during parts of their date, remembered her joy over finding something new to take interest of. Now, as his mind told him to stop and think about what the hell he was doing, he still felt himself leaning down, a hand gently, and gingerly brushing aside tendrils of her bangs. And, as his heart pounded in his chest, and his head telling him, \"Damn it, Shirou, no!\", he bent down towards her. I love you, Saber, was what he had wanted to say, but the second his fingers left her skin, and her eyes flickered open slowly, Shirou had launched back away from her desk with speed he hadn't known he'd possessed, his heart having leapt into his throat as he watched her stare ahead of herself absently. He hugged the wall behind him, staring with heavy trepidation as King Arthur groaned softly and slowly rose from her uncomfortable position on her desk. Her left hand massaged her neck as her gaze swept over the paperwork left to be done."},
